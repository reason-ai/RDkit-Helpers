# RDkit-Helpers
rdkit_pandas_tools_extension inspired by Pat Walters rdkit_utils. The key difference is this code is geared towards making it easy to quickly add multiple columns to a dataframe with a single line of code by giving short strings as arguments to methods. 
Method naming is similar to RDkit PandasTools except with conventional python method formating (all lower case with underscores). Example: 'add_col_to_frame' instead of 'AddColToFrame'
